convert terrible store locators into useful google my maps

problem: mobile view store locators just don't work, they're super slow, don't work well with gestures. google searches are not reliable ways to find what retail stores sell what products.

solution: convert the store locator lists into google my maps that I can view right in my google maps

hurrah!
