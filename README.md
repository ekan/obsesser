problem: mobile view store locators just don't work, they're super slow, don't work well with gestures. google searches are not reliable ways to find what retail stores sell what products.

solution: convert the store locator lists into google my maps that I can view right in my google maps

hurrah!

<rant> google my maps UX still sucks, it's difficult to find, there's no way to easily browse/search user-generated maps other than those google has curated, you basically HAVE to have the share link or its useless. and then you'll be using a my map, switch to another app, come back to google maps and the map you were just viewing is gone. but still, it's the better than store locator maps </rant>

## converted my maps

**[Billion Oyster Project Member Coupon Participating Restaurants (NYC)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VgnYLGEV0Ps-uxxrRreYCfWFMgAtck9R&usp=sharing)**
* As a member of the Billion Oyster Project, you get 5 coupons for a half dozen oysters! ...And an email listing the restaurant locations.

**[Athletic Brewing Co Retail Locations (East Coast)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y_7nsA-qVCTAjjGPUsc60L9TzbayjfH7&usp=sharing)**
* Non-alcoholic beer is all the rage, or will be in 5-10 years. Athletic Brewing is one of the few microbreweries with great non-alcoholic beer that tastes like an IPA but with 60-70 calories and .5% alcohol. You can drink these guys walking down the street folks!

**[Mother Dirt Retail Locations (US, Australia, UK)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yw6_oryDraPlj2KnzYkQ-dbmv755UYLj&usp=sharing)**
* I started running/working out more in my 30s and deodorant just stopped working. Got tired of smelling myself so tried Mother Dirt. It actually works! Some people never shower and just use this stuff, that's gross to me but to each your own. I just don't want to smell.
